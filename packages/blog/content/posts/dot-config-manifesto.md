name this: the .config guidelines?

when is the last time you looked at your project's file structure? was it when you migrated to ducks? was it when you made a node-packages monorepo? with this blog post, I how I make you take one more look, and maybe see the need for an improvement. then I'll offer my solution, taken from other places in a programmer's life.

ok first, open a node project you have or any project for that matter. node is just more likely to have this problem. what do you see? do you see something been overwhelming? something out of place? something all over the place?

if you can't see it, it's because we are all used to it. it's all the **config** files on your root directory of the project. all the eslintrcs and gemfiles and podfiles and prettierrc.jss and what not.

these files are just all over our root dir, just staring back at me while I think of how to get rid of them. but I can't. but I want to. but I need them. it can't be just me with this problem. there must be more people with that same thought stream.


we put stuff in src, partly because we have our own space there.
