Let's get this out of the way. This is my first post!

I wanted to make a blog for the longest time. I never took the time to complete one, even though I tried several times to start one, using static site generators on my own domain.

Yesterday night, I read a [post](https://dev.to/brunolemos/tutorial-100-code-sharing-between-ios-android--web-using-react-native-web-andmonorepo-4pej) from @brunolemos on dev.to, on my phone. It was a technical post like the ones I would like to make, and it looked great on my phone screen, so I made an account (and even put a small monthly donation, I'm a sucker for betas of all kinds üòÅ). Now it's the next morning, and I am writing this first post to explain myself and in a few minutes I'll be typing my first actual post.

Look forward to that! Thank you and see you in the comments soon.
